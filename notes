Resource Nodes:
    Replace bullet system with resource nodes
    resource nodes have percentage for production penalty based on excessive use
    production will stop when production percentage is below 25%

Production Timer:
    Do not produce every tick to spread load
    Reduce production bonus per level, instead increase speed    

Prehistoric Era:
    Pit houses/dugouts (dwellings that consumed wood, hides, stone for construction) Consumed resources like wood for framing, earth for insulation, animal hides/plants for roofing
    Wattle and daub huts Consumed wood for the wattle (woven lattice), clay/mud for daub (coating), plants/reeds for thatched roofing
    Rock shelters/caves (consumed animal hides, wood for reinforcement)
    Primitive quarries/mines (produced stone, flint, obsidian for tools)
    Earthen Mounds/Tumuli - Burial and ceremonial mounds made of piled earth and stone, like Silbury Hill and Newgrange.
    Megaliths - Massive stone constructions like standing stones, dolmens, and passage tombs built using crude stone-moving techniques.
    Crannogs - Fortified artificial islands in lakes/marshes, built with timber piles and connected by a causeway.
    Brochs - Drystone hollow-walled structures found in Scotland, possibly defensive towers or homes for extended families.
    Longhouses (large wooden houses for multiple families)

Ancient Civilizations:
    Mud brick houses (consumed mud/clay, straw, wood)
    Stone quarries (produced building stone)
    Pottery kilns (consumed wood/fuel to produce ceramics)
    Granaries (stored/consumed agricultural produce)
    Primitive smelters (consumed ores, charcoal to produce metals)
    Ziggurats - Massive stepped pyramids made of mud-brick, built by Mesopotamians like the Sumerians.
    Aqueducts - Stone masonry channels and bridges to transport water, perfected by the ancient Romans.
    Amphitheaters - Large oval or circular open-air venues for events, with sloping stone seating around a central area.
    Insulae - Ancient Roman apartment buildings, some rising up to 7-8 stories using timber framing and brick/concrete.

Paleolithic Age
    Lower Paleolithic (oldest stone tool cultures like Oldowan and Acheulean)
    Buildings: Caves, rock shelters, basic huts
    Resources: Stone tools, fire, hunted animals, gathered plants

Middle Paleolithic (more advanced stone tool cultures like Mousterian)
    Buildings: Pit houses, animal hide tents/shelters
    Resources: Specialized stone tools, fire, hunted herd animals

Upper Paleolithic (modern human behaviors emerge)
    Buildings: Longhouses, rock/mud dwellings
    Resources: Complex stone/bone tools, art/decoration, tailored clothing

Mesolithic Age
    Transitional period between Paleolithic and Neolithic
    Buildings: Semi-permanent wood/reed huts, seasonal camps
    Resources: Microliths (small stone tools), bows/arrows, domesticated dog, specialized hunting/fishing

Neolithic Age
    Neolithic Revolution (origins of agriculture, pottery, permanent settlements)
    Buildings: Mud-brick houses, granaries, early temples
    Resources: Domesticated plants/animals, pottery, polished stone tools, weaving

Early Medieval:
    Motte and Bailey Castles - Early medieval fortifications with a wooden tower on a mound (motte) and an enclosed courtyard (bailey).
    Stave Churches - Wooden post churches built by the Vikings in Scandinavia using intricate corner joints.
