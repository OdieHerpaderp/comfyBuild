Prehistoric Era:
    Pit houses/dugouts (dwellings that consumed wood, hides, stone for construction) Consumed resources like wood for framing, earth for insulation, animal hides/plants for roofing
    Wattle and daub huts Consumed wood for the wattle (woven lattice), clay/mud for daub (coating), plants/reeds for thatched roofing
    Rock shelters/caves (consumed animal hides, wood for reinforcement)
    Primitive quarries/mines (produced stone, flint, obsidian for tools)
    Earthen Mounds/Tumuli - Burial and ceremonial mounds made of piled earth and stone, like Silbury Hill and Newgrange.
    Megaliths - Massive stone constructions like standing stones, dolmens, and passage tombs built using crude stone-moving techniques.
    Crannogs - Fortified artificial islands in lakes/marshes, built with timber piles and connected by a causeway.
    Brochs - Drystone hollow-walled structures found in Scotland, possibly defensive towers or homes for extended families.
    Longhouses (large wooden houses for multiple families)

Paleolithic Age
    Lower Paleolithic (oldest stone tool cultures like Oldowan and Acheulean)
    Buildings: Caves, rock shelters, basic huts
    Resources: Stone tools, fire, hunted animals, gathered plants

Middle Paleolithic (more advanced stone tool cultures like Mousterian)
    Buildings: Pit houses, animal hide tents/shelters
    Resources: Specialized stone tools, fire, hunted herd animals

Upper Paleolithic (modern human behaviors emerge)
    Buildings: Longhouses, rock/mud dwellings
    Resources: Complex stone/bone tools, art/decoration, tailored clothing

Mesolithic Age
    Transitional period between Paleolithic and Neolithic
    Buildings: Semi-permanent wood/reed huts, seasonal camps
    Resources: Microliths (small stone tools), bows/arrows, domesticated dog, specialized hunting/fishing

Neolithic Age
    Neolithic Revolution (origins of agriculture, pottery, permanent settlements)
    Buildings: Mud-brick houses, granaries, early temples
    Resources: Domesticated plants/animals, pottery, polished stone tools, weaving

Ancient Civilizations:
    Mud brick houses (consumed mud/clay, straw, wood)
    Stone quarries (produced building stone)
    Pottery kilns (consumed wood/fuel to produce ceramics)
    Granaries (stored/consumed agricultural produce)
    Primitive smelters (consumed ores, charcoal to produce metals)
    Ziggurats - Massive stepped pyramids made of mud-brick, built by Mesopotamians like the Sumerians.
    Aqueducts - Stone masonry channels and bridges to transport water, perfected by the ancient Romans.
    Amphitheaters - Large oval or circular open-air venues for events, with sloping stone seating around a central area.
    Insulae - Ancient Roman apartment buildings, some rising up to 7-8 stories using timber framing and brick/concrete.

    The ancient Mesopotamians had a diverse diet that included a significant amount of fruits, vegetables, grains, and meat/animal products. However, the evidence suggests they likely consumed more plant-based foods like grains, fruits, and vegetables overall compared to meat.
    Grains, especially barley, were a staple food used to make bread and beer. Barley was described as the "staff of life" in Mesopotamia 
    A wide variety of fruits and vegetables were cultivated and consumed, including dates, pomegranates, apples, figs, apricots, grapes, onions, garlic, leeks, lettuce, radishes, beets, and more
    Meat sources included domesticated livestock like sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs, as well as wild game, fowl, and fish. However, beef was noted as being "in short supply" compared to other meats
    While meat was certainly part of the diet, the search results emphasize the importance and prevalence of plant-based foods like grains, fruits, and vegetables in Mesopotamian cuisine

    Frogs were commonly found in the rivers and marshes of Mesopotamia. They were used in healing rituals and incantations, sometimes being caught live, recited over, and then released back into the water
    Fish like the giritu-fish were also utilized in Mesopotamian healing practices. One ritual involved having the patient urinate on the head of a live giritu-fish before releasing it back into a canal
    In addition to medicinal uses, fish and other aquatic creatures like turtles were caught and consumed as food sources in the Mesopotamian diet
    The rivers and marshlands of Mesopotamia provided abundant aquatic wildlife that was hunted and trapped, including various species of fish, waterfowl like ducks and geese, and reptiles like turtles
    Some wild aquatic birds like pelicans were even domesticated and trained by the Mesopotamians to assist in fishing

Early Medieval:
    Motte and Bailey Castles - Early medieval fortifications with a wooden tower on a mound (motte) and an enclosed courtyard (bailey).
    Stave Churches - Wooden post churches built by the Vikings in Scandinavia using intricate corner joints.
    Monasteries - Religious complexes with churches, dormitories, cloisters, built with stone masonry.
    Wattle and Daub Houses - Thatched roof houses with walls made of woven wooden lattice covered in daub (mud/clay).

Middle Ages:
    Timber framed houses (consumed wood, wattle and daub)
    Water mills (produced flour from grains, consumed water power)
    Forges/smithies (consumed charcoal, metals to produce tools/weapons)
    Tanneries (consumed animal hides to produce leather)
    Mines (produced coal, ores, minerals)

High Medieval:
    Romanesque Churches - Massive stone churches and cathedrals with thick walls, round arches, vaulted ceilings.
    Stone Keeps - Rectangular towers at the center of castles, providing fortified residence for lords.
    Walled Cities - Urban centers ringed by thick defensive stone walls and gates, like Constantinople.
    Gothic Cathedrals - Ornate stone cathedrals with ribbed vaults, flying buttresses, stained glass windows.

Renaissance/Early Industrial:
    Glassworks (consumed wood/coal to produce glass products)
    Brickworks/kilns (produced fired bricks, consumed wood/coal)

    Stone and brick manor houses
    Timber-framed houses
    Early skyscrapers (5-6 stories) in cities

Early Modern Age:
    Baroque and Rococo palaces and mansions
