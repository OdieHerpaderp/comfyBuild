Buildings.mjs has a new format: 
    Building: 
        buildingName: {
            age: (number),
            category: (string),
            info: (string),
            build: (array of resources)
            recipes: (array of recipes)
            requiredResearch: (array of strings)
        }

    Recipe:
        {
            consume: (array of resources),
            produce: (array of resources)
        }

    Resource:
        {
            name: (string),
            amount: (number)
        }
        OR: (not yet supported)
        {
            type: (string),
            amount: (number),
            minTier: (number),
            maxTier: (number)
        }

example: 
const buidings = {
    headquarters: {
        category: "wonderNatural"
    },
    dolmen: {
        age: 1,
        category: "housing",
        info: "Several slabs of stone provide ample shelter.",
        build: [{ name: "stone", amount: 1 }],
        recipes: [{
            consume: [
                { name: "water", amount: 1 },
                { name: "berry", amount: 1 }
            ],
            produce: [{ name: "population", amount: 4 }]
        }],
        requiredResearch: ["housing1"]
    }
}

- If there is at least 1 recipe, this new format is used. Make sure to convert the entire building at once!

- Resources must have a name or type (not both) and an amount, everything else is optional with defaults
    - Note: categories are not yet supported, don't use them for now.
- All numbers must be positive integers
- For now, the first recipe is the only recipe that's used. This will be updated soonâ„¢
- Produce resources cannot be categories (how would that even work?).
- Housing recipe produce must contain exactly 1 "resource": { name: "population", amount: (number) }. Everything else (including categories) is ignored. 





ResourceTypes: 
Not yet implemented, this is merely a suggestion

Format: 
    categoryName: (array of ResourceDescriptors)

    ResourceDescriptor: 
        {
            resourceName: (string),
            tier: (number),
            value: (number)
        }

example: 
const resourceTypes = {
    tool: [
        { resourceName: "toolBlunt", tier: 1, value: 1 },
        { resourceName: "toolFlint", tier: 2, value: 1 },
        { resourceName: "toolCopper", tier: 3, value: 2 },
    ]
}
